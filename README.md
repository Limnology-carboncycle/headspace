# Getting Started

"headspace" is a collection of R and JMP scripts to calculate pCO2 in freshwater samples using data from headspace analysis. "headspace" scripts account for the carbonate equilibrium in the equilibration vessel, a frequently disregarded issue when applying the headspace method in freshwater research. We offer a collection of tools to calculate pCO2 accounting for carbonate equilibria, and also to calculate the error associated with the use of a headspace analysis that does not account for the carbonate equilibria.

"headspace" comes as a collection of R scripts (Rheadspace.R and Rheadspace_table.R) and a JMP SAS script. R scripts are command line tools, while the JMP SAS script runs within JMP as a user-friendly GUI. 

# Prerequisites

R scripts have been tested in R version 3.6.3. No additional libraries beyond those included in customary R installations are required.
